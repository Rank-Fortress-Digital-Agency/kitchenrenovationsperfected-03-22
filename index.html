            This year’s designs complement the simple luxury of organic style,
            while increased functionality becomes the main goal of updates and
            upgrades. These trends are all about helping your kitchen work your
            way, adding substance and style that’s sure to last for years.

            Not content with simply finding a place for everything, homeowners
            look to add functionality to kitchen storage in 2022, too. “Working
            pantries,” which include areas like
            <a

            or a place to store and use small appliances, come in at #5 on the
            NKBA trend list.

            Sinks will see major upgrades in 2022, and there are two styles
            vying for your attention. “The past 20 months have proven that

            >, and your kitchen sink is no different.

          <p>
            Greens and blues will continue to dominate home design in 2022, and
            the kitchen is no exception. But according to the NKBA, white and
            wood tones will also be popular. Together, these hues are the
            foundation for today’s

              >popular organic style</a
            >. While the NKBA reports painted wood is still the most-popular
            cabinet choice, designers agree that wood grain, especially in light
            and medium tones, is gaining ground in the kitchen.

            Choosing kitchen colors can feel like a big commitment. The kitchen
            is a space the whole family uses every day, and it’s not so easily
            changed as a bedroom or living room, which can typically be
            redecorated or
            <a

              >repainted in a matter of hours</a
            >. In the kitchen, cabinets, walls, countertops, appliances,
            flooring, and backsplash tile all come together
            <a
              href="https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/color-schemes/inspiration/kitchen-color-scheme/"
              >to form a cohesive palette</a
            >, so your color choices carry some weight. Remodeling every time
            the latest fads change isn’t feasible for most, but there are some
            kitchen color trends that you can trust won’t be going away anytime
            soon.

            “Black is definitely making its way into the kitchen as a ‘pop’ of
            color this year,”.

            on the island, instead of coating the entire kitchen. Or consider
            going dark on the lower cabinets while keeping the upper ones light
            and bright. Using black as an accent requires less of a commitment
            but still makes a statement.

              >tracks with the warming trend</a
            >
            we’ve been seeing over the past couple of years, as people seek out
            neutrals that feel cozy rather than crisp. Warm grays offer more
            depth and interest than pure white, while maintaining the
            versatility that makes neutrals so popular in kitchens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vroom foresees kitchen color trends transitioning from softer whites
            and blues and toward warm, grounded hues like terra-cotta, blush,
            and even plum. “The beachy or farmhouse color palettes are taking a
            step back, and those rich earthy tones are stepping up,” . You can
            also expect to see more natural wood cabinetry in kitchens as
            homeowners embrace the texture and color inherent in the wood.
